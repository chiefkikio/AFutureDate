title: A Future Date Merchandise

##Note to day 1 host
Post the link to the
<a href="https://teespring.com/a-future-date">merchandise site</a> here,
but do <em>something</em> nicer than just a link.

Definitely don't just leave it looking like this. That would be embarrassing.

<p>
How about a photo or two?

There. Still got it.
