<h1 id="page-title">A Future Date</h1>

<p>
Did you miss CSUN ATC, SXSW, or another a11y & inclusive design conference this year because of covid?
A Future Date is a volunteer-led virtual event with 3 days of curated sessions that were canceled
at major accessibility conferences. Our goal is to continue to build up the a11y community and
provide learning opportunities that were missed due to covid-19. Sessions will be captioned.
